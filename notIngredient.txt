Place chicken pieces in a bowl. Sprinkle with cornstarch, salt, and white pepper. Toss chicken to coat evenly and set aside.
Heat 1 teaspoon cooking oil in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir in soy sauce, hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, sambal oelek, and sesame oil. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside.
Heat 2 tablespoons cooking oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet or wok until very hot. Add chicken pieces carefully to the hot oil. Cook, stirring, until chicken pieces are lightly browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes total.
Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken from the skillet and add the remaining 2 tablespoons cooking oil. Add carrots, shallots, and broccoli, and stir quickly and continually, 3 to 4 minutes.
Stir in prepared sauce, and cook until the vegetables are as tender as you like, 2 to 3 minutes.

Return chicken pieces and cook, stirring often, until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.

How to Make Pancakes
You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics.
Pancake Ingredients
You likely already have everything you need to make this pancake recipe. If not, here's what to add to your grocery list.
Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.
Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.
Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.
Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.
Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.
Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.
How to Make Pancakes From Scratch
It's not hard to make homemade pancakes - you just need a good recipe. That's where we come in!
Sift the dry ingredients together.
Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.
Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.
Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.
Continue cooking until brown on both sides.
When to Flip Pancakes
Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles start to form on the top and the edges look dry and set.
How to Reheat Pancakes
Store leftover pancakes in an airtight container in the fridge for about a week.
Refrain from adding toppings (such as syrup) until right before you serve them so the pancakes don't get soggy.
Can You Save Pancake Batter?
Don't let leftover pancake batter go to waste! Store the batter in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days.
Can You Freeze Pancakes?
Yes, you can freeze pancakes and pancake batter.
To freeze cooked pancakes: Allow the pancakes to cool completely, then arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet.
This recipe is one to hand down to your grandkids. Fluffy and delicious. Haven't bought a box of pancake mix in months!
