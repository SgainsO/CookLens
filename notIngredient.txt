Place chicken pieces in a bowl. Sprinkle with cornstarch, salt, and white pepper. Toss chicken to coat evenly and set aside.

Heat 1 teaspoon cooking oil in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Stir in soy sauce, hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, sambal oelek, and sesame oil. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons cooking oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet or wok until very hot. Add chicken pieces carefully to the hot oil. Cook, stirring, until chicken pieces are lightly browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes total. The chicken pieces will cause spattering, so be sure to use a long-handled spoon or other utensil to move the chicken around.

Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken from the skillet and add the remaining 2 tablespoons cooking oil. Add carrots, shallots, and broccoli, and stir quickly and continually, 3 to 4 minutes.

Stir in prepared sauce, and cook until the vegetables are as tender as you like, 2 to 3 minutes.

Place cornstarch in a small bowl and stir in 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Keep stirring until there are no lumps. Add cornstarch slurry to the skillet and rapidly stir until well combined. Return chicken pieces and cook, stirring often, until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.

Remove from heat, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and serve hot.

erfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).
How to Make Pancakes

You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
Pancake Ingredients

You likely already have everything you need to make this pancake recipe. If not, here's what to add to your grocery list:

· Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.
· Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.
· Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.
· Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.
· Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.
· Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.
How to Make Pancakes From Scratch

It's not hard to make homemade pancakes — you just need a good recipe. That's where we come in! You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

1. Sift the dry ingredients together.
2. Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.
3. Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.
4. Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.
5. Continue cooking until brown on both sides.
When to Flip Pancakes

Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles start to form on the top and the edges look dry and set. This will usually take about two to three minutes on each side.
How to Reheat Pancakes

Store leftover pancakes in an airtight container in the fridge for about a week. Refrain from adding toppings (such as syrup) until right before you serve them so the pancakes don't get soggy.

Can You Save Pancake Batter?

Don't let leftover pancake batter go to waste! Store the batter in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days. If you plan to keep it longer than that, it's best to freeze the batter.

"This recipe is one to hand down to your grandkids," raves ashleyalbertine. "Fluffy and delicious. Haven't bought a box of pancake mix in months! Just add a bit of vanilla and poof! Magic."

"Perfect," according to Laura W. "Delicious! If you're looking for some thick, hearty pancakes these are the ones to make! Made them exactly as the recipe states and then added mini-chocolate chips to each cake as they were on the frying pan (before flipping)."

"I made this recipe exactly as written...the kids were eating them off the plate faster than I could cook them," says aellis1970. "They are so delicious, they were eaten without syrup."
